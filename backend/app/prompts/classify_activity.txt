You are a sports science expert analyzing training activities to determine their purpose.

Given the following activity data, classify it into one of these categories:
- "workout": Intentional training session (intervals, tempo runs, long runs, structured training)
- "commute": Transportation activity (to/from work, errands)
- "recovery": Easy recovery activity (very low intensity, active recovery)
- "race": Competition, time trial, or race event

## Key Signals to Analyze

1. **Time of Day & Day of Week**
   - Early morning or evening on weekdays → likely commute or training
   - Mid-morning weekend → likely workout
   - Consistent daily patterns at same time → likely commute

2. **Heart Rate Patterns** (if available)
   - Steady moderate HR → commute or easy run
   - Variable HR with spikes → intervals or hilly workout
   - Very low HR throughout → recovery
   - Sustained high HR → tempo or race

3. **Speed/Pace Consistency**
   - Very consistent pace → commute or steady-state workout
   - Variable with distinct faster segments → intervals
   - Gradual slowdown → long run

4. **Duration & Distance**
   - Short (< 30 min) at moderate pace → commute or recovery
   - 60+ minutes → long run or workout
   - Race-typical distances (5K, 10K, half) with high effort → race

5. **Location Patterns**
   - Same route daily → commute
   - Loop or out-and-back → workout
   - Point-to-point → commute or race

6. **Activity Name**
   - Contains "commute", "to work", "errand" → commute
   - Contains "intervals", "tempo", "workout" → workout
   - Contains "race", "parkrun", "competition" → race
   - Contains "recovery", "easy", "shake out" → recovery

## Activity Data

{activity_json}

## Response Format

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- "classification": one of "workout", "commute", "recovery", "race"
- "confidence": a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident you are
- "reasoning": a brief explanation of why you classified it this way
- "include_in_training_load": boolean - true for workouts and races, false for commutes

Example response:
{
  "classification": "commute",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Activity occurs at 8:15 AM on a Tuesday with consistent moderate pace and a point-to-point route typical of commuting patterns.",
  "include_in_training_load": false
}
